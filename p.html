            </p>

            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to ServiCore ("ServiCore," "Service," "Platform"), a
                product owned and operated by Intelygic ("Intelygic," "we,"
                "us," or "our"), a company registered in the State of Indiana,
                USA.
            </p>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and
                safeguard information when you, as a "Customer" (the legal
                entity, such as a consulting firm) or an "End-User" (an employee
                or authorized agent of a Customer), use our
                software-as-a-service platform and our website ServiCore.io.
            </p>
            <p>
                This policy also outlines our commitments as a
                <strong>Data Processor</strong> for the information our
                Customers upload, and it details the rights and choices
                available to you regarding your information.
            </p>
            <p>
                This Service is not intended for individuals under the age of
                18, and we do not knowingly collect data from children.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Our Role: Data Controller vs. Data Processor</h2>
            <p>
                It is crucial to understand our two different roles under data
                protection laws.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Intelygic as Data Controller:</strong> We act as the
                    Data Controller for the personal information we collect
                    <em>from</em> our <strong>Customers</strong> to register,
                    manage, and bill their accounts. This includes data like the
                    business administrator's name, email address, and billing
                    information. We control the "why" and "how" this data is
                    processed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Intelygic as Data Processor:</strong> We act as the
                    Data Processor for the information that our
                    <strong>Customers</strong> and their
                    <strong>End-Users</strong> upload, manage, and store within
                    the ServiCore platform. This "Service Data" includes, but is
                    not limited to, several types of lists, timesheets, expense
                    reports, receipts, project details, and information about
                    the Customer's own clients ("Customer's Clients").
                    <strong
                        >Our Customer (the firm) is the Data Controller for this
                        Service Data</strong
                    >, and we only process it on their behalf and according to
                    their instructions.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Information We Collect (As Data Controller)</h2>
            <p>
                We collect the following information to provide and manage our
                Service:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Customer Account Information:</strong> When a
                    Customer signs up, we collect the business name,
                    administrator's name, email address, phone number, and
                    physical address.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Payment Information:</strong> We
                    <strong>do not</strong> collect or store your full credit
                    card or bank account details. We use third-party payment
                    processors (e.g. Stripe, PayPal) to handle all payment
                    transactions. We only receive a transaction confirmation,
                    subscription details, and partial payment information (like
                    the last four digits of a card) from our processor.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cookies and Website Analytics:</strong> When you
                    visit our marketing website, ServiCore.io or Intelygic.com,
                    we use common tools like Google Analytics and advertising
                    pixels to understand website traffic, usage patterns, and
                    marketing effectiveness. This may collect your IP address,
                    browser type, and device information.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Security and Operational Data:</strong> When you are
                    logged into the ServiCore platform, we automatically log
                    your IP address and approximate location, browser type, and
                    device information. We use this <em>exclusively</em> for
                    security purposes, such as detecting and preventing
                    unauthorized access, fraud, and to allow our Customers to
                    enforce login restrictions for their accounts. We
                    <strong>do not</strong> use this data for marketing or
                    analytics.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                We only process the following "Service Data" on behalf of our
                Customers:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>End-User Information:</strong> Our Customers provide
                    information about their End-Users, such as name, email, and
                    other optional information, to create user account.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Customer's Client Information:</strong> Our
                    Customers store contact information for their clients (e.g.,
                    name, address, email, phone) to manage projects and send
                    invoices. We use this client email <em>only</em> to verify
                    and provide access to the Customer Portal if initiated by
                    the Customer's Client.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Timesheet and Expense Data:</strong> We process all
                    data End-Users log, including time entries, project notes,
                    expense details, and any files (e.g., PDF or image receipts)
                    they upload. We <strong>do not</strong> parse, scan, or
                    decipher the contents of these uploaded files; we simply
                    store them for the Customer's auditing and record-keeping
                    purposes.

            <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
            <p>
                We take the security of your data seriously and implement
                industry-best practices:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Encryption:</strong> We use SSL/TLS to encrypt all
                    data in transit (between your browser and our servers). We
                    also use encryption at rest to protect your data stored in
                    our databases.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Tenancy:</strong> We offer two environments:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Multi-Tenant:</strong> Customer data is
                            logically segregated and isolated to ensure no
                            Customer can access another Customer's data.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Private-Tenant:</strong> The Customer is
                            provisioned on a completely isolated, dedicated
                            server environment with its own database and file
                            storage for the highest level of security.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Access Control:</strong> We limit internal access to
                    your data to only those employees who require it to perform
                    their job.
                </li>

                    <strong>During Subscription:</strong> We retain your Service
                    Data as long as your account is active.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>After Cancellation:</strong> If you cancel your
                    subscription, your account will cease to remain active
                    immediately or some other agreed upon time. Customers
                    administrator may request special access to retrieve data
                    within 30 days. After this 30-day period, we will
                    permanently delete all your Service Data from our active
                    systems.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> We may be required to
                    retain certain information for longer periods for legal,

            <h2>10. International Data Transfers</h2>
            <p>
                Intelygic is based in the United States. If you are accessing
                ServiCore from other regions (such as the European Union or
                Canada), your information will be transferred to, stored, and
                processed in the United States. We take all necessary measures
                to ensure that these data transfers are lawful, typically by
                entering into Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) with our
                Customers and vendors where required.
