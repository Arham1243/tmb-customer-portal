            <p>
                "Confidential Information" means all non-public information
                disclosed by one party to the other. Intelygic's Confidential
                Information includes the Service, its source code, and its
                pricing. Your Confidential Information includes your Customer
                Data. Both parties agree to use Confidential Information only
                for the purpose of this Agreement and to protect it with the
                same degree of care they use for their own confidential
                information (but no less than reasonable care).
